### Question 2 : What is a Bash?
---
Bash is GNU Project's * shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating system. The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’, a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell sh.Thrfore, IT is also an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh).It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive use. In addition, most sh script; scan be run by Bash without modification.a script is a program or sequence of instructions that is interpreted or carried out by another program rather than by the computer processor (as a compiled program is). 

The improvements offered by Bash include:
Command line editing 
Unlimited size command history 
Job Control 
Shell Functions and Aliases 
Indexed arrays of unlimited size 
Integer arithmetic in any base from two to sixty-four 

#### GNU Project's 
***
The project to develop the GNU system,GNU is an operating system that is free software—that is, it respects users' freedom. The development of GNU made it possible to use a computer without software that would trample your freedom. It is a Unix-like operating system. That means it is a collection of many programs: applications, libraries, and developer tools. 
#### Linux is the kernel
***
the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.

#### Shell
***
shell is a UNIX term for the interactive user interface with an operating system. The shell is the layer of programming that understands and executes the commands a user enters. A shell usually implies an interface with a command syntax (think of the DOS operating system and its "C:>" prompts and user commands such as "dir" and "edit"). 
As the outer layer of an operating system, a shell can be contrasted with the kernel, the operating system's inmost layer or core of services.

#### A command interpreter 
***
is the part of a computer operating system that understands and executes commands that are entered interactively by a human being or from a program.

 ### Question4: What are the benefits of working with the command line rather than a GUI? 
---
 #### GUI vs Command Line
  
 "GUI" is :Graphical User Interface
 user interface based on graphics (icons and pictures and menus) instead of text; uses a mouse as well as a keyboard as an input device

CLIs are used on computers and other devices such as routers and switches. The command line allows the user to customize commands with special parameters to more precisely control how the computer or device functions. Some tasks can be scripted, making repetitive tasks more efficient and less prone to error. The command line can be faster in some cases, but requires the memorization of numerous commands over time. For this reason, the command line interface normally is used only by professionals and advanced home users.

A GUI is easier to use for more casual users. Many common operations, such as copying and pasting, can be performed by using just the mouse. Icons and menus take the place of text commands and do not have to be memorized. It is also easier to switch between multiple active tasks using a graphical interface. However, advanced operations may only be accessible via the command line.
