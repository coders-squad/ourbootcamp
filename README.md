##### What is a Bash?

# Bash is GNU Project's * shell, or command language interpreter, for the GNU operating system. The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’, a pun on Stephen Bourne, the author of the direct ancestor of the current Unix shell sh.Thrfore, IT is also an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh).It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive use. In addition, most sh script; scan be run by Bash without modification.a script is a program or sequence of instructions that is interpreted or carried out by another program rather than by the computer processor (as a compiled program is).

Command line editing 
Unlimited size command history 
Job Control 
Shell Functions and Aliases 
Indexed arrays of unlimited size 
Integer arithmetic in any base from two to sixty-four 

# GNU Project's 
---
The project to develop the GNU system,GNU is an operating system that is free software—that is, it respects users' freedom. The development of GNU made it possible to use a computer without software that would trample your freedom. It is a Unix-like operating system. That means it is a collection of many programs: applications, libraries, and developer tools. 
# Linux is the kernel
---
the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.

# Shell
***
shell is a UNIX term for the interactive user interface with an operating system. The shell is the layer of programming that understands and executes the commands a user enters. A shell usually implies an interface with a command syntax (think of the DOS operating system and its "C:>" prompts and user commands such as "dir" and "edit"). 
As the outer layer of an operating system, a shell can be contrasted with the kernel, the operating system's inmost layer or core of services.

### A command interpreter 
***
is the part of a computer operating system that understands and executes commands that are entered interactively by a human being or from a program.
